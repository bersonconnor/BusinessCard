# Javadocs
These javadocs serve as technical documentation for this application. Traditionally, a javadoc only displays public methods and fields, but since the context of this application is a challenge, I provided javadocs that includes all methods for ease of evaluation. Since the javadocs are [HTML previews](https://htmlpreview.github.io/), I removed the header, footer, and other links that are broken due to the format. The remaining tabs and links are non-functional for the same reason.
